# Discover Songs Website
I intended to create a website that prompts users to answer questions in order to recieve a song in return. 
# Challenges
I struggled a lot with storing data from the radio buttons and linking certain aspects to another tab. I initially wanted to attempt pulling from the internet to provide song recommendations but was not able to figure it out in time. I used a list of around a 100 songs pulled from Spotify to produce a working website.
# What I Would Change
I do intend to keep working on this project and hope I can achieve a product that I wanted to earlier. I hope to add more questions, I did not add many as I was really struggling with storing the data. Along with that, I want to figure out how to gather data from the internet and additionally a lot of stylistic changes.
